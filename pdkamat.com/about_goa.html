<span class="title">About Goa</span><br />
<br />
A holiday-maker's paradise, complete with sprawling hills, meandering rivers, 
lush green fields and miles and miles of virgin beaches...Goa has it all!<br />
<br />
With its sunlit beaches, green hills, silvery waterways, waterfalls, and 
lakes, 
Goa has always been a unique spot with vast potentialities, which are now being 
re-discovered continuously. The gift of nature has endowed Goa with enchanting 
loveliness and idyllic serenity. Its culture is a unique blend of the Indian 
and 
Portuguese, laced with the Goan spirit of laughter, good fellowship and songs. 
Besides a long and checkered history, Goa reflects in its monuments, churches, 
temples, forts, its colourful festivals throughout the year, music, cuisine, 
and 
even a distinct style of livingâ€”a harmonious blending of the East and West.<br />
<br />
The people of Goa are affable and hospitable, and there is a lot more to this 
glorious speck, than the sun, sand, and natural beauty, making its allurement 
pretty distinct from other Indian states in India. The lush and tranquil 
countryside 
plays a perfect host to all visitors with enchanting views. Undulating land 
with 
hills and waterways intermingling, and the Arabian Sea touching its shores all 
along, really becomes a scene of beauty. To add to this glory, the fascinating 
relaxed lifestyle among marvellous expanses of palm-fringed white beaches, 
azure 
blue seas, scenic splendours of wooden hills and green valleys, finding rivers 
and ponds dominated by rising steeples of white-washed churches and temples 
across 
its expanse of land, over the centuries, have evolved a culture which is a 
combination of Portuguese and Indian art.
