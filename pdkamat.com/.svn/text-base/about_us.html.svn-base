<span class="title">About Us</span><br />
<br />
PD Kamat & Sons is a company with a highly progressive and professional 
approach aimed at result orientation. The seeds of the company were sown by Mr. 
P.D. 
Kamat, a pioneer of his era. Mr. Kamat started off with taking building 
contracts for houses and bungalows for individuals in 1966. He later 
diversified his 
portfolio by including clubs, school buildings and cottages for resorts like 
those 
of the Taj Group. His attention to quality and timeliness is what gave the 
company its strong foundation. Aldona Institute and The Panjim Gymkhana 
Football 
Ground Stands is a testimonial to his quality standards. <br />
<br />
From taking building contracts for houses and bungalows for individuals way 
back 
in 1966 to ownerships, personal bungalows and interior (furniture) design 
management, PD Kamat &amp; Sons has come a long way.<br />
<br />
We offer customized construction services that result in cost savings in the 
management of the entire life cycle of commercial buildings and facilities. 
Through 
unprecedented involvement in every step of the construction process, we have 
raised the bar for quality standards.<br />
<br />
Adoption of Zero Error policy backed by well trained professionals with years 
of 
experience, guarantees maintenance of standard of excellence. We have never 
compromised on quality and have successfully achieved a high level of customer 
appreciation resulting in long-lasting relations. <br />
<br />
Perhaps nothing else better describes the PD Kamat & Sons' attitude and 
heritage 
more than these golden words, "a living philosophy that constantly strives to 
give customers beyond the best".<br />
<br />
Needless to say, PD Kamat &amp; Sons' commitment to its client goes way beyond 
just 
providing shelters.
