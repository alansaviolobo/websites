(290,'Housing Wanted','Hello..I am 40 year old disabled mother of 3 (20,18,15 yrs.) my spouse is 50 yrs & his children whom live on there own are 27 & 28 years & we have 2 grandchildren & I am looking for housing within our budget.I had to send my youngest 2 children to Nebraska to live with my parents, my oldest is in College in NE, so right now it just my husband & myself. We am looking to pay in the $300- $500 range & some one to work with us on the deposit. Our rent where we are at is going to increase in Jan. to $680 plus my utilities & I can not afford it. I am in the process of getting financial help with our rent, but with all the people applying for funds, I do not want to count on this yet (this would be a portion of our monthly rent) & I dont want to end up on the street...it is hard enough as it is struggling, when we were used to a steady pay check, so I am trying to be proactive & find us a new home. I used to be a nurse & if my doctors would let me go back to work I would, but can not. I also have a service animal, so you must be willing to work with us on that. Currently we live in Bernalillo, but will move in Bernalillo or to Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, etc. We dont have any family here so I thought I would give this a try & I dont get out too much. If you have anything I would love to hear from you. Thanks so much for all your time & consideration in this matter.

(307,'Looking for Shop/workshop space','Im looking for some affordable shop space for rent. Would love to find ~1500 sq/ft, with high ceilings (12+ foot), no asbestos hanging from the walls, and at least one garage style door. I am comming out of a place that while affordable, had to many hassles with flodding, asbestos on the walls, and chunks of concrete falling from the ceiling. I need basic 60-100amp electrical service (either included in rent or separate), ability to install my 235k BTU commercial waste oil furnace, and preferably smooth flat concrete floors. A space that needs a little work, provided the price was right, would also be very acceptable. I dont believe that I could go much smaller than about 1200 sq/ft, and cant really afford to go much bigger less the price was really right. Would also be interested in splitting a bigger space 2500-4000 sq/ft with someone if there is anyone out there looking. I bring with me, a host of automotive tools, portable automotive lift, 60 gallon compressor, zep parts washer, bead blasting cabinet, work benches, and waste motor oil furnace (heated 1300 sq/ft 18foot ceilings no insulation to 75F last winter). So if you have been eying a space that was too big for you buy yourself let me know. Looking to stay around the $300-400/mo range for 1200 to 1500 sq/ft. I am not looking for a commercial space to run a full time business out of. If you dont have a space for rent but might know of someone that does please drop me the info. Im looking for something that I can start setting up in mid Jan or for Feb 1st.<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\" src=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/placeholder-3525642?target=_top&mouseover=N\"></script><br>Read business articles at <a href=\"http://www.BusinessArticles.info\">Business Articles.info</a>',1,',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,334,',14,'20090114','9:48:21 MST',1,'','','$1000/mo','','','','',0,0,'solomon@some365.com',3,0,'ALL',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1105769261','c52e9',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),

So, as long as everything goes according to plan we could be out of here and have the place move in ready by Feb 1st. You will have the option to renew the lease once ours is over - or you could move out a couple days before April 1st. It would cost $1350 to move in - your first months rent and a security deposit (I need to make sure you dont wreck the place!). It is a 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment with washer and dryer hookups, a deck off one of the bedrooms with a sliding door, and the fridge is included with the apartment. The apartment is about 900 square feet, its plenty large enough for one person, and has been quite comfortable for just me and my wife. The apartment is also located on the bottom floor of a quiet building, no kids or parties ever (and Ive been here for 2 years). If you are interested please contact me so I can send you pictures, or we can set up a time for you to come see the apartment. One important note, this complex is not dog friendly, and cats require a $500 non-refundable deposit. Not my choice... but thats just the way it is. Also, the house Im purchasing needs flooring (carpet and/or laminate) as well as painting.

This wasn\'t a war of \"no choice,\" but rather a very avoidable war in which Israeli actions played the major role in instigating.\n\nIsrael has a long history of deliberately using violence and other provocative measures to trigger reactions in order to create a pretext for military action, and to portray its opponents as the aggressors and Israel as the victim. According to the respected Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz in his recent book, Defending the Holy Land, Israel most notably used this policy of \"strategic escalation\" in 1955-1956, when it launched deadly raids on Egyptian army positions to provoke Egypt\'s President Nasser into violent reprisals preceding its ill-fated invasion of Egypt; in 1981-1982, when it launched violent raids on Lebanon in order to provoke Palestinian escalation preceding the Israeli invasion of Lebanon; and between 2001-2004, when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly ordered assassinations of high-level Palestinian militants during declared ceasefires, provoking violent attacks that enabled Israel\'s virtual reoccupation of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael\'s current assault on Gaza bears many trademark elements of Israel\'s long history of employing \"strategic escalation\" to manufacture a major crisis, if not a war.\n\nMaking War \'Inevitable\'\nThe countdown to a war began, according to a detailed report by Barak Raviv in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, when Israel\'s Defense Minister Ehud Barak started planning the current attack on Gaza with his chiefs of staff at least six months ago ? even as Israel was negotiating the Egyptian brokered ceasefire with Hamas that went into effect on June 19. During the subsequent ceasefire, the report contends, the Israeli security establishment carefully gathered intelligence to map out Hamas\' security infrastructure, engaged in operational deception, and spread disinformation to mislead the public about its intentions.\n\nThis revelation doesn\'t confirm that Israel intended to start a war with Hamas in December, but it does shed some light on why Israel continuously took steps that undermined the terms of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas, even though Hamas respected their side of the agreement.\n\nIndeed, there was a genuine lull in rocket and mortar fire between June 19 and November 4, due to Hamas compliance and only sporadically violated by a small number of launchings carried out by rival Fatah and Islamic Jihad militants, largely in defiance of Hamas. According to the conservative Israeli-based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center\'s analysis of rocket and missile attacks in 2008, there were only three rockets fired at Israel in July, September, and October combined. Israeli civilians living near Gaza experienced an almost unprecedented degree of security during this period, with no Israeli casualties.\n\nYet despite the major lull, Israel continually raided the West Bank, arresting and frequently killing \"wanted\" Palestinians from June to October, which had the inevitable effect of ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to respond. Moreover, while the central expectation of Hamas going into the ceasefire was that Israel would lift the siege on Gaza, Israel only took the barest steps to ease the siege, which kept the people at a bare survival level. This policy was a clear affront to Hamas, and had the inescapable effect of undermining both Hamas and popular Palestinian support for the ceasefire.\n\nBut Israel\'s most provocative action, acknowledged by many now as the critical turning point that undermined the ceasefire, took place on November 4, when Israeli forces auspiciously violated the truce by crossing into the Gaza Strip to destroy what the army said was a tunnel dug by Hamas, killing six Hamas militants. Sara Roy, writing in the London Review of Books, contends this attack was \"no doubt designed finally to undermine the truce between Israel and Hamas established last June.\"\n\nThe Israeli breach into Gaza was immediately followed by a further provocation by Israel on November 5, when the Israeli government hermetically sealed off all ways into and out of Gaza. As a result, the UN reports that the amount of imports entering Gaza has been \"severely reduced to an average of 16 truckloads per day ? down from 123 truckloads per day in October and 475 trucks per day in May 2007 ? before the Hamas takeover.\" These limited shipments provide only a fraction of the supplies needed to sustain 1.5 million starving Palestinians.\n\nIn response, Hamas predictably claimed that Israel had violated the truce and allowed Islamic Jihad to launch a round of rocket attacks on Israel. Only after lethal Israeli reprisals killed over 10 Hamas gunmen in the following days did Hamas militants finally respond with volleys of mortars and rockets of their own. In two short weeks, Israel killed over 15 Palestinian militants, while about 120 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel, and although there were no Israeli casualties the calm had been shattered.\n\nIt was at this time that Israeli officials launched what appears to have been a coordinated media blitz to cultivate public reception for an impending conflict, stressing the theme of the \"inevitability\" of a coming war with Hamas in Gaza. On November 12, senior IDF officials announced that war with Hamas was likely in the two months after the six-month ceasefire, baldly stating it would occur even if Hamas wasn\'t interested in confrontation. A few days later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert publicly ordered his military commanders to draw up plans for a war in Gaza, which were already well developed at the time. On November 19, according to Raviv\'s report in Haaretz, the Gaza war plan was brought before Barak for final approval.\n\nWhile the rhetoric of an \"inevitable\" war with Hamas may have only been Israeli bluster to compel Hamas into line, its actions on the ground in the critical month leading up to the official expiration of the ceasefire on December 19 only heightened the cycle of violence, leaving a distinct impression Israel had cast the die for war.\n\nFinally, Hamas then walked right into the \"inevitable war\" that Israel had been preparing since the ceasefire had gone into effect in June. With many Palestinians believing the ceasefire to be meaningless, Hamas announced it wouldn\'t renew the ceasefire after it expired on December 19. Hamas then stood back for two days while Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militants fired volleys of mortars and rockets into Israel, in the context of mutually escalating attacks. Yet even then, with Israeli threats of war mounting, Hamas imposed a 24-hour ceasefire on all missile attacks on December 21, announcing it would consider renewing the lapsed truce with Israel in the Gaza Strip if Israel would halt its raids in both Gaza and the West Bank, and keep Gaza border crossings open for supplies of aid and fuel. Israel immediately rejected its offer.\n\nBut when the Israel Defence Forces killed three Hamas militants laying explosives near the security fence between Israel and Gaza on the evening of December 23, the Hamas military wing lashed out by launching a barrage of over 80 missiles into Israel the following day, claiming it was Israel, and not Hamas, that was responsible for the escalation.\n\nLittle did they know that, according to Raviv, Prime Minister Olmert, and Defense Minister Barak had already met on December 18 to approve the impending war plan, but put the mission off waiting for a better pretext. By launching more than 170 rockets and mortars at Israeli civilians in the days following December 23, killing one Israeli civilian, Hamas had provided reason enough for Israel to unleash its long-planned attack on Gaza on December 27.\n\nThe Rationale for War\nIf Israel\'s goal were simply to end rocket attacks on its civilians, it would have solidified and extended the ceasefire, which was working well, until November. Even after November, it could have addressed Hamas\' longstanding ceasefire proposals for a complete end to rocket-fire on Israel, in exchange for Israel lifting its crippling 18-month siege on Gaza.\n\nInstead, the actual targets of its assault on Gaza after December 27, which included police stations, mosques, universities, and Hamas government institutions, clearly reveal that Israel\'s primary goals go far beyond providing immediate security for its citizens. Israeli spokespersons repeatedly claim that Israel\'s assault isn\'t about seeking to effect regime change with Hamas, but rather about creating a \"new security reality\" in Gaza. But that \"new reality\" requires Israel to use massive violence to degrade the political and military capacity of Hamas, to a point where it agrees to a ceasefire with conditions more congenial to Israel. Short of a complete reoccupation of Gaza, no amount of violence will erase Hamas from the scene.\n\nConfirming the steps needed to create the \"new reality,\" the broader reasons why Israel chose a major confrontation with Hamas at this time appear to be the cause of several other factors unrelated to providing immediate security for its citizens.\n\nFirst, many senior Israeli political and military leaders strongly opposed the June 19 ceasefire with Hamas, and looked for opportunities to reestablish Israel\'s fabled \"deterrent capability\" of instilling fear into its enemies. These leaders felt Israel\'s deterrent capability was badly damaged as a result of their withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and especially after the widely criticized failures in the 2006 Israeli war with Hezbollah. For this powerful group a ceasefire was at best a tactical pause before the inevitable renewal of conflict, when conditions were more favorable. Immediately following Israel\'s aerial assault, a New York Times article noted that Israel had been eager \"to remind its foes that it has teeth\" and to erase the ghost of Lebanon that has haunted it over the past two years.\n\nA second factor was pressure surrounding the impending elections set to take place in early February. The ruling coalition, led by Barak and Livni, have been repeatedly criticized by the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, who is leading in the polls, for not being tough enough on Hamas and rocket-fire from Gaza. This gave the ruling coalition a strong incentive to demonstrate to the Israeli people their security credentials in order to bolster their chances against the more hawkish Likud.\n\nThird, Hamas repeatedly said it wouldn\'t recognize Mahmud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority after his term runs out on January 9. The looming political standoff on the Palestinian side threatens to boost Hamas and undermine Abbas, who had underseen closer security coordination with Israel and was congenial to Israeli demands for concessions on future peace proposals. One possible outcome of this assault is that Abbas will remain in power for a while longer, since Hamas will be unable to mobilise its supporters in order to force him to resign.\n\nAnd finally, Israel was pressed to take action now due to its sense of the American political timeline. The Bush administration rarely exerted constraint on Israel and would certainly stand by in its waning days, while Barack Obama would not likely want to begin his presidency with a major confrontation with Israel. The Washington Post quoted a Bush administration official saying that Israel struck in Gaza \"because they want it to be over before the next administration comes in. They can\'t predict how the next administration will handle it. And this is not the way they want to start with the new administration.\"\n\nAn Uncertain Ending\nAs the conflict rages to an uncertain end, it\'s important to consider Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz\'s contention that Israel\'s history of manufacturing wars through \"strategic escalation\" and using overwhelming force to achieve \"deterrence\" has never been successful. In fact, it\'s the primary cause of Israel\'s insecurity because it deepens hatred and a desire for revenge rather than fear.\n\nAt the same time, there\'s no question Hamas continues to callously sacrifice its fellow Palestinian citizens, as well as Israeli civilians, on the altar of maintaining its pyrrhic resistance credentials and its myopic preoccupation with revenge, and fell into many self-made traps of its own. There had been growing international pressure on Israel to ease its siege and a major increase in creative and nonviolent strategies drawing attention to the plight of Palestinians such as the arrival of humanitarian relief convoys off of Gaza\'s coast in the past months, but now Gaza lies in ruins.\n\nBut as the vastly more powerful actor holding nearly all the cards in this conflict, the war in Gaza was ultimately Israel\'s choice. And for all this bloodshed and violence, Israel must be held accountable.\n\nWith the American political establishment firmly behind Israel\'s attack, and Obama\'s foreign policy team heavily weighted with pro-Israel insiders like Dennis Ross and Hillary Clinton, any efforts to hold Israel accountable in the United States will depend upon American citizens mobilizing a major grassroots effort behind a new foreign policy that will not tolerate any violations of international law, including those by Israel, and will immediately work towards ending Israel\'s siege of Gaza and ending Israel\'s occupation.\n\nBeyond that, the most promising prospect for holding Israel accountable is through the increasing use of universal jurisdiction for prosecuting war crimes, along with the growing transnational movement calling for sanctions on Israel until it ends its violations of international law. In what would be truly be a new style of foreign policy, a transnational network that focuses on Israeli violations of international law, rather than the state itself, could become a counterweight that forces policymakers in the United States, Europe, and Israel to reconsider their political and moral complicity in the current war, in favor of taking real steps towards peace and security in the region for all peoples.\n\n\nSteve Niva, a professor of International Politics and Middle East Studies at The Evergreen State College, is a contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus.

I would only emphasize that preserving the occupation of the west bank territories is no less of a goal than deterrence and election ploys. Indeed, after Hamas has voiced its readiness to accept a two state solution on the 67 borders, the Israeli government had a clear interest in further terrorism on the part of Hamas. Otherwise people would begin to wonder why Israel doesn\'t settle the conflict. As always, Israel is responding to A \"peace offensive\", in the words of Avner Yaniv. \n \nName:  Van Date: Jan 08, 2009 \nYour not to pro-Hamas are you. I would blame anyone for finally putting their foot down after being bombarded with missiles over the last 2 years. And yes, Isreal is playing their cards strategically because of the up-and-coming change in the American president, but wouldn\'t you, if you knew it changed your strategic options. And not to mention, with the charter of Hamas being the total destruction of Isreal, don\'t you think Isreal wants to maximize its options in order to rid themselves of an un-ending terror that won\'t go away. And back when Isreal got back some of their land, they welcomed the Palestinians to stay, but what happened to the Jews in Gaza, they were kicked out. And when the lull in missiles occured last year, I believe Isreal kept pressure because Hamas was bringing in missles from Egypt via the tunnels. I don\'t blame them for trying to thwart that effort. \n \nName:  Don Macleay Date: Jan 09, 2009 \n\nWhat happened during this period in the way of targeting killings? How many times has Israel killed someone with an air strike since they \"left\" Gaza? How many civilians have been killed when it happens? Is there a list somewhere of these actions and the number of casualties? \n \n \nName:  Tevye Salstrand Date: Jan 09, 2009 \n\"...Israel continuously took steps that undermined the terms of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas, even though Hamas respected their side of the agreement.\" This comment is completely errounous! In 2008 (Jan to Dec)?1,571 missiles and 1,531 mortars were launched from Gaza into Israel, targeting citizens and infrastructure. You need to check your facts before you shoot from the hip.  \n \nName:  bryan Date: Jan 09, 2009 \nTevye, It may be that that number of missiles and mortars were launced into Israel during the year of 2008, but if you read the next paragraph it explains that Hamas did indeed respect their side of the ceasefire that took effect on June 19: \n\n\"Indeed, there was a genuine lull in rocket and mortar fire between June 19 and November 4, due to Hamas compliance and only sporadically violated by a small number of launchings carried out by rival Fatah and Islamic Jihad militants, largely in defiance of Hamas. According to the conservative Israeli-based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center\'s analysis of rocket and missile attacks in 2008, there were only three rockets fired at Israel in July, September, and October combined. Israeli civilians living near Gaza experienced an almost unprecedented degree of security during this period, with no Israeli casualties\" \n\nMr. Niva then goes on to explain how Israel\'s Nov. 4th raid that killed 6 Hamas members, along with sealing off Gaza, caused a renewal in rocket fire from Gaza. \n \n \nName:  Aaron Malcolm Date: Jan 11, 2009 \nThank you for presenting the facts. Revisionists of history will never say that the Israeli occupying power always has total control of Gaza in every aspect outside of that area, and which has enforced collective punishment all because the Palestinians had voted against the Fatah in January 2006. The fact that Hamas adhered to a ceasefire back then is a defacto recognition of the state of Israel, which Tel Aviv rejected by keeping a blockade against Gaza since then. \n\nSupporters of this inhumanity perpetrated by the Israeli government don\'t seem to understand that when you are way stronger than someone, having pushed that person already seriously beaten into a corner with your foot on his head, don\'t be surprised that the person tries to fight back by any means at his disposition. \n\nBy the way, given the fact that Tzipi Livni has always repeated that there is \"no humanitarian crisis\" and if Israel has nothing to hide in its effort to carry on its current brutal military campaign, then why is it still preventing the media from entering Gaza to report what is really happening over there?\n \n \n  \nYou may add a new comment here.

(343,'Available ASAP  Till Aug 2009','Me and my wife are buying a house but we have 2 months left on our lease. So, as long as everything goes according to plan we could be out of here and have the place move in ready by Feb 1st. You will have the option to renew the lease once ours is over - or you could move out a couple days before April 1st. It would cost $1350 to move in - your first months rent and a security deposit (I need to make sure you dont wreck the place!). It is a 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment with washer and dryer hookups, a deck off one of the bedrooms with a sliding door, and the fridge is included with the apartment. The apartment is about 900 square feet, its plenty large enough for one person, and has been quite comfortable for just me and my wife. The apartment is also located on the bottom floor of a quiet building, no kids or parties ever (and Ive been here for 2 years). If you are interested please contact me so I can send you pictures, or we can set up a time for you to come see the apartment.

(344,'War of Choice: How Israel Manufactured the Gaza Escalation',' www.fpif.org \n \n\nIsrael has repeatedly claimed that it had \"no choice\" but to wage war on Gaza on December 27 because Hamas had broken a ceasefire, was firing rockets at Israeli civilians, and had \"tried everything in order to avoid this military operation,\" as Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni put it.\n\nThis claim, however, is widely at odds with the fact that Israel\'s military and political leadership took many aggressive steps during the ceasefire that escalated a crisis with Hamas, and possibly even provoked Hamas to create a pretext for the assault. This wasn\'t a war of \"no choice,\" but rather a very avoidable war in which Israeli actions played the major role in instigating.\n\nIsrael has a long history of deliberately using violence and other provocative measures to trigger reactions in order to create a pretext for military action, and to portray its opponents as the aggressors and Israel as the victim. According to the respected Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz in his recent book, Defending the Holy Land, Israel most notably used this policy of \"strategic escalation\" in 1955-1956, when it launched deadly raids on Egyptian army positions to provoke Egypt\'s President Nasser into violent reprisals preceding its ill-fated invasion of Egypt; in 1981-1982, when it launched violent raids on Lebanon in order to provoke Palestinian escalation preceding the Israeli invasion of Lebanon; and between 2001-2004, when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly ordered assassinations of high-level Palestinian militants during declared ceasefires, provoking violent attacks that enabled Israel\'s virtual reoccupation of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael\'s current assault on Gaza bears many trademark elements of Israel\'s long history of employing \"strategic escalation\" to manufacture a major crisis, if not a war.\n\nMaking War \'Inevitable\'\nThe countdown to a war began, according to a detailed report by Barak Raviv in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, when Israel\'s Defense Minister Ehud Barak started planning the current attack on Gaza with his chiefs of staff at least six months ago ? even as Israel was negotiating the Egyptian brokered ceasefire with Hamas that went into effect on June 19. During the subsequent ceasefire, the report contends, the Israeli security establishment carefully gathered intelligence to map out Hamas\' security infrastructure, engaged in operational deception, and spread disinformation to mislead the public about its intentions.\n\nThis revelation doesn\'t confirm that Israel intended to start a war with Hamas in December, but it does shed some light on why Israel continuously took steps that undermined the terms of the fragile ceasefire with Hamas, even though Hamas respected their side of the agreement.\n\nIndeed, there was a genuine lull in rocket and mortar fire between June 19 and November 4, due to Hamas compliance and only sporadically violated by a small number of launchings carried out by rival Fatah and Islamic Jihad militants, largely in defiance of Hamas. According to the conservative Israeli-based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center\'s analysis of rocket and missile attacks in 2008, there were only three rockets fired at Israel in July, September, and October combined. Israeli civilians living near Gaza experienced an almost unprecedented degree of security during this period, with no Israeli casualties.\n\nYet despite the major lull, Israel continually raided the West Bank, arresting and frequently killing \"wanted\" Palestinians from June to October, which had the inevitable effect of ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to respond. Moreover, while the central expectation of Hamas going into the ceasefire was that Israel would lift the siege on Gaza, Israel only took the barest steps to ease the siege, which kept the people at a bare survival level. This policy was a clear affront to Hamas, and had the inescapable effect of undermining both Hamas and popular Palestinian support for the ceasefire.\n\nBut Israel\'s most provocative action, acknowledged by many now as the critical turning point that undermined the ceasefire, took place on November 4, when Israeli forces auspiciously violated the truce by crossing into the Gaza Strip to destroy what the army said was a tunnel dug by Hamas, killing six Hamas militants. Sara Roy, writing in the London Review of Books, contends this attack was \"no doubt designed finally to undermine the truce between Israel and Hamas established last June.\"\n\nThe Israeli breach into Gaza was immediately followed by a further provocation by Israel on November 5, when the Israeli government hermetically sealed off all ways into and out of Gaza. As a result, the UN reports that the amount of imports entering Gaza has been \"severely reduced to an average of 16 truckloads per day ? down from 123 truckloads per day in October and 475 trucks per day in May 2007 ? before the Hamas takeover.\" These limited shipments provide only a fraction of the supplies needed to sustain 1.5 million starving Palestinians.\n\nIn response, Hamas predictably claimed that Israel had violated the truce and allowed Islamic Jihad to launch a round of rocket attacks on Israel. Only after lethal Israeli reprisals killed over 10 Hamas gunmen in the following days did Hamas militants finally respond with volleys of mortars and rockets of their own. In two short weeks, Israel killed over 15 Palestinian militants, while about 120 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel, and although there were no Israeli casualties the calm had been shattered.\n\nIt was at this time that Israeli officials launched what appears to have been a coordinated media blitz to cultivate public reception for an impending conflict, stressing the theme of the \"inevitability\" of a coming war with Hamas in Gaza. On November 12, senior IDF officials announced that war with Hamas was likely in the two months after the six-month ceasefire, baldly stating it would occur even if Hamas wasn\'t interested in confrontation. A few days later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert publicly ordered his military commanders to draw up plans for a war in Gaza, which were already well developed at the time. On November 19, according to Raviv\'s report in Haaretz, the Gaza war plan was brought before Barak for final approval.\n\nWhile the rhetoric of an \"inevitable\" war with Hamas may have only been Israeli bluster to compel Hamas into line, its actions on the ground in the critical month leading up to the official expiration of the ceasefire on December 19 only heightened the cycle of violence, leaving a distinct impression Israel had cast the die for war.\n\nFinally, Hamas then walked right into the \"inevitable war\" that Israel had been preparing since the ceasefire had gone into effect in June. With many Palestinians believing the ceasefire to be meaningless, Hamas announced it wouldn\'t renew the ceasefire after it expired on December 19. Hamas then stood back for two days while Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militants fired volleys of mortars and rockets into Israel, in the context of mutually escalating attacks. Yet even then, with Israeli threats of war mounting, Hamas imposed a 24-hour ceasefire on all missile attacks on December 21, announcing it would consider renewing the lapsed truce with Israel in the Gaza Strip if Israel would halt its raids in both Gaza and the West Bank, and keep Gaza border crossings open for supplies of aid and fuel. Israel immediately rejected its offer.\n\nBut when the Israel Defence Forces killed three Hamas militants laying explosives near the security fence between Israel and Gaza on the evening of December 23, the Hamas military wing lashed out by launching a barrage of over 80 missiles into Israel the following day, claiming it was Israel, and not Hamas, that was responsible for the escalation.\n\nLittle did they know that, according to Raviv, Prime Minister Olmert, and Defense Minister Barak had already met on December 18 to approve the impending war plan, but put the mission off waiting for a better pretext. By launching more than 170 rockets and mortars at Israeli civilians in the days following December 23, killing one Israeli civilian, Hamas had provided reason enough for Israel to unleash its long-planned attack on Gaza on December 27.\n\nThe Rationale for War\nIf Israel\'s goal were simply to end rocket attacks on its civilians, it would have solidified and extended the ceasefire, which was working well, until November. Even after November, it could have addressed Hamas\' longstanding ceasefire proposals for a complete end to rocket-fire on Israel, in exchange for Israel lifting its crippling 18-month siege on Gaza.\n\nInstead, the actual targets of its assault on Gaza after December 27, which included police stations, mosques, universities, and Hamas government institutions, clearly reveal that Israel\'s primary goals go far beyond providing immediate security for its citizens. Israeli spokespersons repeatedly claim that Israel\'s assault isn\'t about seeking to effect regime change with Hamas, but rather about creating a \"new security reality\" in Gaza. But that \"new reality\" requires Israel to use massive violence to degrade the political and military capacity of Hamas, to a point where it agrees to a ceasefire with conditions more congenial to Israel. Short of a complete reoccupation of Gaza, no amount of violence will erase Hamas from the scene.\n\nConfirming the steps needed to create the \"new reality,\" the broader reasons why Israel chose a major confrontation with Hamas at this time appear to be the cause of several other factors unrelated to providing immediate security for its citizens.\n\nFirst, many senior Israeli political and military leaders strongly opposed the June 19 ceasefire with Hamas, and looked for opportunities to reestablish Israel\'s fabled \"deterrent capability\" of instilling fear into its enemies. These leaders felt Israel\'s deterrent capability was badly damaged as a result of their withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and especially after the widely criticized failures in the 2006 Israeli war with Hezbollah. For this powerful group a ceasefire was at best a tactical pause before the inevitable renewal of conflict, when conditions were more favorable. Immediately following Israel\'s aerial assault, a New York Times article noted that Israel had been eager \"to remind its foes that it has teeth\" and to erase the ghost of Lebanon that has haunted it over the past two years.\n\nA second factor was pressure surrounding the impending elections set to take place in early February. The ruling coalition, led by Barak and Livni, have been repeatedly criticized by the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, who is leading in the polls, for not being tough enough on Hamas and rocket-fire from Gaza. This gave the ruling coalition a strong incentive to demonstrate to the Israeli people their security credentials in order to bolster their chances against the more hawkish Likud.\n\nThird, Hamas repeatedly said it wouldn\'t recognize Mahmud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority after his term runs out on January 9. The looming political standoff on the Palestinian side threatens to boost Hamas and undermine Abbas, who had underseen closer security coordination with Israel and was congenial to Israeli demands for concessions on future peace proposals. One possible outcome of this assault is that Abbas will remain in power for a while longer, since Hamas will be unable to mobilise its supporters in order to force him to resign.\n\nAnd finally, Israel was pressed to take action now due to its sense of the American political timeline. The Bush administration rarely exerted constraint on Israel and would certainly stand by in its waning days, while Barack Obama would not likely want to begin his presidency with a major confrontation with Israel. The Washington Post quoted a Bush administration official saying that Israel struck in Gaza \"because they want it to be over before the next administration comes in. They can\'t predict how the next administration will handle it. And this is not the way they want to start with the new administration.\"\n\nAn Uncertain Ending\nAs the conflict rages to an uncertain end, it\'s important to consider Israeli military historian Zeev Maoz\'s contention that Israel\'s history of manufacturing wars through \"strategic escalation\" and using overwhelming force to achieve \"deterrence\" has never been successful. In fact, it\'s the primary cause of Israel\'s insecurity because it deepens hatred and a desire for revenge rather than fear.\n\nAt the same time, there\'s no question Hamas continues to callously sacrifice its fellow Palestinian citizens, as well as Israeli civilians, on the altar of maintaining its pyrrhic resistance credentials and its myopic preoccupation with revenge, and fell into many self-made traps of its own. There had been growing international pressure on Israel to ease its siege and a major increase in creative and nonviolent strategies drawing attention to the plight of Palestinians such as the arrival of humanitarian relief convoys off of Gaza\'s coast in the past months, but now Gaza lies in ruins.\n\nBut as the vastly more powerful actor holding nearly all the cards in this conflict, the war in Gaza was ultimately Israel\'s choice. And for all this bloodshed and violence, Israel must be held accountable.\n\nWith the American political establishment firmly behind Israel\'s attack, and Obama\'s foreign policy team heavily weighted with pro-Israel insiders like Dennis Ross and Hillary Clinton, any efforts to hold Israel accountable in the United States will depend upon American citizens mobilizing a major grassroots effort behind a new foreign policy that will not tolerate any violations of international law, including those by Israel, and will immediately work towards ending Israel\'s siege of Gaza and ending Israel\'s occupation.\n\nBeyond that, the most promising prospect for holding Israel accountable is through the increasing use of universal jurisdiction for prosecuting war crimes, along with the growing transnational movement calling for sanctions on Israel until it ends its violations of international law. In what would be truly be a new style of foreign policy, a transnational network that focuses on Israeli violations of international law, rather than the state itself, could become a counterweight that forces policymakers in the United States, Europe, and Israel to reconsider their political and moral complicity in the current war, in favor of taking real steps towards peace and security in the region for all peoples.\n\n\nSteve Niva, a professor of International Politics and Middle East Studies at The Evergreen State College, is a contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus. He is currently writing a book on the relationship between Israel\'s military violence and Palestinian suicide bombings.\n \n \n',1,',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,334,',129,'20090114','12:54:27 MST',1,'','','','','','','',0,0,'solomon@some365.com',1,1,'USA',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1128081466','ee5f7',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),

[But] considering these grave attacks against...humanity, Bolivia will stop having diplomatic relations with Israel,\" Morales said in a speech before diplomats in the government palace. \n\n\"We haven\'t received official confirmation from the Bolivian government,\" the Israeli consul in La Paz, Roberto Nelkenbaum, told Reuters by telephone. \n\nThe diplomat said he was \"surprised and sad\" after hearing Morales\' comments in local media and that the two countries have had good diplomatic relations for more than 50 years. \n\nIsrael launched the offensive in Gaza on Dec. 27, seeking to force the ruling Hamas militant group to stop rocket attacks on southern Israel. \n\nMorales, a leftist, is a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who on Jan. 6 expelled Israel\'s ambassador in protest over the operation in Gaza. \n\nMorales told the country\'s diplomatic corps that the Israeli attack seriously threatened world peace and he called for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his cabinet to face criminal charges. \n\nMorales chided the United Nations\' \"Insecurity Council\" for its lukewarm response to the crisis and said the UN General Assembly should condemn the invasion. \n\nHe also said President Shimon Peres should be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize for failing to stop the invasion. \n\nMorales and Chavez have worked to cultivate ties to Iran, which supports \nHamas. Morales met Tuesday with visiting Iranian officials, who gave him a letter from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad thanking Morales for his previously voicing supporting for the Palestinians. \n\nRelated articles: \n\nA week after expelling Israeli officials over Gaza op, Venezuela looks to repair ties \n\nTo protest Gaza op, Venezuela gives Israeli diplomats 72 hours to leave \n\nIsrael weighs expelling Venezuelan envoys after Chavez dismisses ambassador \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGet Haaretz news headlines delivered daily to your inbox!\n????

(435,'Two Beautiful Women Home for the Holidays ISO of Night to Remember - w4w','Heres the deal: I am back in good ole upstate NY for a few days following Christmas to see a friend of mine whos locally attending school. Neither of us are at all familiar with the local scene and would love to find a girl (or even a group of friends) to show us the ropes. I can assure you that this is not another bi-curious posting. We would love to join up for anything remotely queer, ranging from an open-mic to a raging night on the town. We are both confident, beautiful, and intelligent women whove gotten a taste of the west coast LGBT scene and would love to compare it with back home. If youre intent on boxing us in, Id have to deem us more femme than anything else I could come up with, but labels squeeze us until we pop. Invitations complete with pictures are always the most tantalizing, though neither of us (particularly me, as Im due on a 3 thousand mile return flight in a week) are necessarily looking for a romantic engagement.

(436,'What lies behind us, and what lies before us are small matters... - w4w','...compared to what lies within us. I am a newly 40 year old professional, single, white female. I am generous, funny, loving and will do anything for someone. I have been led to the realization about what I truly need and want in my life. I am looking for someone who is college educated, professional, socially aware, socially adept (not inept), funny, clever, kind, generous, interpersonally generous and aware of dynamics. I would prefer someone whose socioecomonic status matches or surpasses mine. I need someone who can handle it when she feels emotions or I show mine. I need it to be so that the only name someone might call would be a term of affection as opposed to \"whore\" or \"ridiculous bitch\". I will make you lunch with funny notes and take care of you when you are sick, all I ask for is that same respect in return. I want to take weekend trips to Vermont and maybe take a real vacation someday with someone I love. I need you to be a gentle spirit with an old soul. I prefer to date true butch women. The style that I refer to is that of KD Lang or Lea DeLaria. I am looking for a butch who is strong, tall, and dominant. Who will take of me in EVERY WAY and allow me to do the same. No stones, please, I love to give too much for that! I ask that you are actually single...meaning not in a relationship, even an \"open\" one. I ask that you not be a woman of color. I prefer to date white women, that is my own preference. I know that gender is a fluid thing, so I am open to all points on the spectrum. I am looking for friends first. I made the \"u-haul on the second date\" mistake once and I will not do that again. I want you to have your own space like I have mine. I love animals of all kinds. I have a couple cats who I love very much. If you like music and politics and books, going to Maine (and actually have enough money to afford to go), watching old movies, camping (cabins please...my back is too fd up to sleep on the ground anymore! lol!), learning new things, physical contact(I am a hugger and a kisser and a back rubber, and I would like you to be that as well), then please contact me. As far as physical appearance goes...I am average height, I am pretty. I am a big woman, but believe me, Ive never had any complaints, I am growing my hair out, so its just almost to the space between my neck and shoulders. I wear glasses. I have hazel eyes and good teeth (you need to have good teeth too). Kids are fine. No druggies, criminals, scammers, cheaters. No diseases that I can catch either. You will need to be willing to take a blood test if the relationship progresses to the point that we talk about physical intimacy. I will do the same obviously. I am D&D free and want to stay that way! I hope to hear from you! One last thing...no one under 30 need respond.

(463,'RECESSION FIGHTING CHEF! GOURMET FOOD ONLY $10 HOUR','FOODLOVINCHEF Personal Chef Services: Are you Tired of the Fast Food Headaches? Are you Sick of feeling nauseated after meals? Want a simple comforting and filling meal? Want to eat one of your childhood favorites like mom made? Want to try something different and new? Want to eat great tasting healthy food? Want to experience in the food world? Want me to recreate a certain dish? These are some questions I ask you because personally I have dealt with many of these instances. For me good food has always given me great satisfaction and has built a solid connection to many of my childhood memories. I think food should not be just a means of survival but rather something you can appreciate and enjoy. In these times of economic hardships I have enlisted myself to fight the recession eating. I know that in these times , we seem to neglect the way we eat. We eat whats convenient, affordable, and what seems to be good. Eating good is so important so let me take the burden of cooking of your hands and make great gourmet food for you or your family. I will also teach my clients to turn their own kitchens into mini restaurants for their family and friends. After using my services a few times you might never need to hire a personal chef again. I will be hands on and show you exactly how to make budgeted gourmet meals for yourself. My Services Explained: I will meet with you on the day of the cooking service and plan a menu catered to your personal needs. I will do the shopping at the store of your choice that is close to your home. I will prepare anywhere from 3-5 meals of your choice with 6 servings each. I will make 6 servings for all meals even if its for one single person. I strongly recommend donating the extra food that will not be eaten to your local homeless shelter. Also the homeless shelters will issue a tax write off for your food donation. Shopping Budget: $100 Dollars Max: I can not spend more than 100 Dollars because I am a recession fighting chef. I will show up to your door empty handed with no tools or equipment. This is to show you how to make use of the kitchen that exists in your home and turn it into a gourmet food making machine. My Hourly: $ Ten Dollars an Hour 3 Meals=4 Hours 4-5 Meals= 5 Hours Gas Fee: $10.00 I will shop, cook, and clean. Seriously, I urge you to inquire about my services because there will be no Personal Chef Out there that will have a deal like this. Im here to help and feed the people who are hungry for good food.

(494,'DECIDED TO DIVORCE? ... CONSIDER DIVORCE MEDIATION','Let me show you how to obtain a divorce or separation at a fraction of the cost of a litigated divorce. Mediation is a non-adversarial process in which an impartial third party - the mediator - facilitates negotiations between the divorcing couple to help them reach a mutually acceptable separation or divorce settlement. Advantages of using mediation over going to court Mediation? * Promotes communication and cooperation (not antagonism and adversity). * Saves thousands of dollars in legal fees. * Keeps you and your spouse (and not divorce lawyers or the judge) in total control of your divorce, including such life-altering decisions as determining what is fair distribution of assets/liabilities, spousal support, custody, parenting time, and child support. * Is confidential, informal and flexible. The sessions are conducted in a private office setting rather than a public court room. * Is completely voluntary. Each spouse has an equal say in the process and they decide the terms of the divorce, not the mediator. * Makes you more committed to the agreement since it is you who works through it instead of your attorneys. * Takes less time than litigation, enabling couples to sooner move ahead with their own lives. * Helps the children win as well, as they see their parents working together for their interests and future, instead of against one another. Give us a call today at The Divorce Mediation Center for a FREE consultation and make an attempt to mediate your divorce or legal separation before hiring a divorce lawyer.

And I won?t force you to sight read ?Greensleeves.? (Blech.) At the end of each month, we?ll decide whether or not to proceed. If you?re not progressing, I?ll steer you to another instructor. What you?ll get ... A printout of every lesson. Illustrations of guitar parts and how an electric guitar works. A CD of every song we?ll cover. Amp and effects basics.

(503,'Private French Lessons','Bonjour, My name is Chantal. I offer French lessons for people of all ages and levels of familiarity with the language. Individuals have different reasons for wanting to learn French: school, leisure, etc. Therefore, based on your unique interest in the language and the culture, I will guide you towards tightening your grasp of the language through speaking, reading, writing, and language/word games. You will thus develop your vocabulary and be able to carry on a basic (or more complex?depending on your experience and knowledge of the language) conversation with ease. I offer lessons at a public place such as the library or cafe. Lessons are typically 1-hr long. I,m a patient and caring person. Please feel free to contact me for more information, as well as with any questions you may have. chabari5@hotmail.com\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1526466-10387700\" target=\"_top\">Buy Panda Antivirus Pro 2009 for $32.47.

If you enjoy working hard and earning an honest living than you can change your familys situation today. I did and now I am grateful I took the leap. It wasnt easy. I believe that great success comes from great effort. Any add that claims that you can get rich quickly in Network Marketing is just creating false hopes. My team creates hope and turns them into paychecks for average families just like yours. Want to learn more? Heres what I am looking for: ~Someone who lights up a room ~Someone who people trust ~Someone who has a passion for skin care, cosmetics, aromatherapy, and Health & wellness ~Someone who doesnt believe in giving up ~Someone who believes that they are able to turn \"nothing\" into \"something\" ~Someone who works hard and is not looking for the \"easy way\" to make a living ~Someone who values time with their family/financial freedom and is willing to work for it If you fit the above description and are serious about working hard and starting a home based business, then I want to interview YOU! Send me an email and tell me why this email got your attention. Phone interviews will be conducted with candidates who meet credential and passion criteria. Thanks for your time.

We Accept: Visa, Mastercard, Debit, Personal Checks Cash Welcome to Make-Up Enhancements By Marcia Permanent Make-Up is a personal decision that only you can make. Permanent make-up (also known as micropigmentation, cosmetic tattooing, and intradermal pigmentation) is a method of applying natural or synthetic pigment into the dermal layer of the skin. This technique has been medically developed and specifically designed for safe, permanent application. Permanent makeup is used for a variety of enhancements such as enhancement of eyebrows, eyeliner, lip liner and lip color. This technique can also be used to treat skin irregularities, scars, and areolas. Beneficial for those clients who: ? Are active and want to save time ? Have poor eyesight ? Have allergies to make-up ? Are physically incapable of applying make-up ? Wish to correct asymmetrical facial features ? Desire freedom from make-up Permanent Make-Up is: ? Artistically applied to enhance your natural appearance ? You?ll look your best ... and no one will suspect ? Save on make-up expenses and have more time in your life ? Thorough consultation lets you see how you will look in advance Eyebrows Properly shaped eyebrows will enhance your face shape and frame your eyes without dominating your features. Multi-colored hair strokes can be blended for a soft, natural look. Eyeliner Soft color can be applied as an enhancement or a thicker defined line for a more dramatic effect. Dimension is created by implanting more color to the outer edges and tapering to the middle. Lips Size, shape and color can be altered. Accentuate the outer lip liner and blend color to the middle for a natural look. Lip enhancement helps prevent lipstick from bleeding and minimizes the appearance of wrinkles. Testimonials ?Makeup enhancements by Marcia changed my look. Her eyelashes and eyeliner products are nothing short of amazing. I have had health issues with my eyes along with several surgeries and Marcia is the only one I trust near my eye area.\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://www.shareasale.com/image/mls.gif\" alt=\"List Your Home online for Free.

(543,'I Can Write a Resume From Scratch.','At some point, most job hunters wonder, \"Can I benefit from a resume writer?\" The answer is Yes! A well-written resume can make all of the difference. With possibly hundreds of applicants for every position to which you apply, your resume needs to stand out and be perfect! HR departments can be quirky. Theres no need to waste hours of your time guessing what works and what doesnt. Let my experience help you today! You can have the edge over other applicants. I have a B.A. in English Writing and am not the typical resume writer. I do personal consultations over the telephone or via email (your choice). I do *NOT* email you a form letter, have you fill it in, then retype it in MS Word and call it a resume! I spend at least 6 hours with every resume I write, fine tuning and perfecting it in every way imaginable. I can write a resume from scratch or simply reformat and edit your old one. I do personal consultations and know that each resume is very different from the previous. I treat your resume as if it was my own; if I wouldnt send it out myself I wont let you!

The actual clothing/costuming depends on two things, the model?s age and her comfort level. This also determines the pay grade.

All our projects are conducted in a professional manner with a skilled photographer, a make-up / hair stylist and a project manager supervising the shoot. Our shoots are very laid back, relaxed and we try to ensure everyone has a good time. We hire models from all across the USA. If the model is under 18 she must have full parental permission before she can be hired for any of our projects. We pay models $30 to $100 per hour dependant.

(730,'Unicycle','My brother is 62 to 63 tall. He just bought this unicycle brand new just a few months ago and it cost him close to a hundred bucks. One of his friends tried riding it down the stairs and unfortunately the tire itself got bent. Other than that, the frame is in perfect and shiny shape. The seat is a bit dusty (in the pictures below) because he hasnt been able to ride it due to the bent tire. By the way- it is easy to change tires; he just hasnt gone around to it yet. Shoot me an e-mail if you have questions about it or if you want to take a look at it. $65 is a great deal for unicycles, especially for this size.\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-2073888-10419774\" target=\"_top\">\n<img src=\"http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2073888-10419774\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Lose weight with Medifast\" border=\"0\"/></a><br><a href=\"http://www.buyoldcars.com\">Old Cars</a>tv ads\nadvertisements\nads\nad\nclassified ads\ntelevision ads\ncommercial ads\nad campaign\nfunny ads\nads technologies\nprint ads\nreal estate ads\npolitical ads\nfor sale ads\n\nradio advertising\nadvertising agencies\nadvertising firms\nbusiness advertising\nsuper bowl advertising\nvintage ad\nsuper ad\nopen ads\nbest ads\nad pages\n',1,',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,334,',88,'20090117','0:09:06 MST',1,'','$','','','','','',0,0,'solomon@some365.com',2,0,'ALL',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1200645525','d3fd4',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),

(733,'13 fiberglass tri hull w/35 horse evinrude','This boat looks dirty, and dingy, but with a little bit of work it runs really good. I messed up trying to change a fuel hose, and broke the fuel pump, and float bowl assembly on the carb. it should be an easy fix for anyone with any mechanical aptitude. I had the boat running a couple weeks ago, and noticed the fuel hose leaking, and tried to change it myself. BTW hammers dont work. I am selling it for $400.00 OR I will trade for a smoker.

(735,'1979 cane cutter bass boat','This is a project Ive been working on since this summer. I bought the boat with a 40 hp merc on it and sold the merc and bought the 70 hp johnson and put on it. Then I sanded and painted the upper deck the olive green color. I wired up all the electrical on the boat and the bilge and both live wells work along with the lights. The trailer has new bearing buddies and 1 new tire. Boat comes with 3 life jackets, a paddle, a anchor, and 2 fire extinguishers (1 new), 2 pedistal seats(1 front and 1 rear) and a new min kota trolling motor mounted on the front. Also has 2 newer (2yrs old or less) deepcycle batteries. Now for the bad, but its not too bad! I took the boat out last weekend to test and the motor was sluggish. Brought it back home and discovered 2 of the ignition coils are cracked, so its running on 1 or 2 cylinders (didnt sound like it though). The coils are only $36 each and yes you can still get them. Price is firm as I really want to keep it, but need to sell because of lack of a job. I can only knock $200 off for the trolling motor, as it is my brothers and I can give it back to him. Boat is titled and registered till 2010. No title on motor. Also have material and foam to finish bench seat. Will also throw in 2 brand new fishing seats. This boat is thisclose to being ready to fish. Get it now before I change my mind and pull the add. 325-668-3444 Randy.\n<p>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=17750&u=68178&m=4927&urllink=&afftrack=\"><img src=\"http://www.shareasale.com/image/repairmanuals_468x60.gif\"  border=\"0\"></a><br>For more on <a href=\"http://www.buyoldcars.com\">Old Cars</a>classifieds, online classifieds, pet classifieds, employment classifieds, car classifieds, motorcycle classifieds, internet classifieds, online classified, community classifieds, search classifieds, dallas morning news classifieds, free classified ad, times picayune classified, classified ads com, classified information, vci classifieds, classifieds com, post free classified, san antonio classified, asbury park press classifieds, post register classifieds, record eagle classifieds, asbury park press classified, classifieds rentals, ',1,',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,334,',89,'20090117','0:17:58 MST',1,'','$','','','','','',0,0,'solomon@some365.com',2,0,'ALL',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1043383553','30133',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),

It has a wire sliding top that fits into grooves on the top of the tank (very nice if you have other pets in the house or children who like to stick their hands in the water). I do not have a stand for it, but I know the local pet stores sell them or you can make your own. It doesnt have any chips or cracks anywhere. As far as I know, it holds water (it did 6 months ago when I took it down). I am looking for a larger fish tank (40 gallon \"breeder\" size - 36W x 18D x 16H) if anyone has one please email me.

Takes less than one hour to make. I designed these and made three in one weekend. No special tools. Readily available materials. My wife made one for a friend. GREAT 4H or Kids project. No special skills needed. Supplement your food budget right from your own backyard or shed. These are the best that I have had for outdoor hutches bar NONE! Light. Easily moved. Good Looking. No rotting/smelly wood hutches. Strong enough to support a Doe and ten 8 week young ones. Made my first ones in 1999 and they are still being used today...10 years later.

I did ours and so many people on our Team. \n\nGo to www.healthandwealthforlife.net and fill in your contact information....look around the website...spend 5 minutes of your life checking this out...it may not be for you, but I know it won\'t be a waste of your time.\n\nOh yeah, think of how many days have already drifted by in 2009...if you don\'t do something what will be different next year at this time? \n\nJason \n954-330-1993 \nwww.advocare.com/08101566 \n\nwww.healthandwealthforlife.net\n\nRemember, its not just about looks.

(1103,'READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT TRULY WORKS!','Turn $25 to $25,000 in days. Read to learn how THIS IS HOW TO BECOME RICH, AND HOW TO TURN 25 DOLLARS INTO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT TRULY WORKS! I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make hundreds of thousands of dollars within weeks (which would soon turn into millions) with only an initial investment of $25.00! So I thought, \"Yeah right, this must be a scam\", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $5.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 250 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured \"What have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $25.00, right?\" Then I invested the measly $25.00 (I use the word \"measly\" because $25 really is measly compared to the money I have made through the initial investment)! Well GUESS WHAT!? within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000! In the third week I had over $10,000 and it\'s still growing. This is actually my fourth week now- and I have made a total of just over $42,000 and it\'s still coming in rapidly. It\'s certainly worth $25.00, and 5 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it works Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! Suggestion, Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It\'s easy. It\'s legal. And, your investment is only $25.00 (Plus postage) IMPORTANT This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends. NOTE Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the HONESTY and INTEGRITY of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it\'s a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 5 easy steps to success (STEP 1) Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper \"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST\", along with your name and address.  Now get 5 US $5.00 bills (or a combination of bills totaling $5) and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper (yellow is best) so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address (for legal purposes), and a $5.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal.  (STEP 2) Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses 1.Stefan Veliceasa Malini 120,Jud Suceava,cod 727350,Romania  2.Judith Sims 1700 S.Main St #155 Las Vegas,NV 89104  3.Vitalii Dubinka 123 S.E.3rd Avenue,#536 Miami,Florida 33131 4.Richard Schenk, 135 Fairview Avenue, Great Neck, New York  5. rob comunale 12480 larimer ave north huntingdon,pa 15642 (STEP 3) Now (CAREFULLY) take the #1 name OFF the list that you see above, move the other names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc ) and add \"YOUR\" name and address information,that will make you receive money(it is for real) as number 5. on the list. (STEP 4) Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.  (STEP 5) Now, post your amended article to at least 250 newsgroups on your web browser. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 250, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! You won\'t get very much unless you post like crazy. )This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &  1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the HONESTY and INTEGRITY of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of INTEGRITY, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way. NOTE You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy.  This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the cash in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, five  members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with five dollars each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $25.00 ($5.00 for each of the first five people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you\'re in business!  \"IMPORTANT\" Be sure to give  \"FIVE\" dollars per participant. Failure to do so will prevent the progress of this business, (PLEASE BE HONEST). DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1 You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting,  Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your  cursor to the bottom of this document (so that the document is \"highlighted\"), and select \'copy\' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer\'s memory. Step 2 Open a blank \'notepad\' file (such as in Microsoft Word) and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the \'edit\' menu select \'paste\'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step 3 Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different settings, you\'ll always have this file to go back to. Step 4 Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Step 5 Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit  menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You\'re done with your first one! Congratulations THAT\'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it should take only about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 250**  That\'s it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive! If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** Now the WHY part Out of 250 postings, say I receive only 5 replies ?(which would be a VERY LOW example!). So then I made $25.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $5.00 make the MINIMUM 250 postings, each with my name at #4 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $125.00 for me, now those 25 each make 250 MINIMUM posts with my name at #3 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $625! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 250 with my name at #2 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $3125! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 250 letters with my name at #1 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $15,625!!! With an original  investment of only $25.00!!!! UN-BELIEVABLE! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $25.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is do you realize that thousands upon thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $25.00 and see if it really works?? I think so People have said, \"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates ?are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. NOTE This program can and will work for you as long as you post the message in at least 250 newsgroups (e.g. message boards). This might take a long time, probably several hours. But remember, as far fetched and ridiculous as it seems, if you follow all the instructions of this system, you will become rich within an extremely short period of time. Believe me,  IT\'S WORTH IT!!! I just urge you to be fair and honest. As long as each person (including you!) sends $5 to everyone on the list, everybody (including you!) will become extremely wealthy within just a couple of months, and will start receiving money within the first week or two! Legal Note. This system is perfectly legal. It is not a lottery or a scheme intending to defraud, it is rather a business. It is part of the mail order business. By receiving money from others, you do not offer them a lottery or any prize based on chance; you simply offer them a service (i.e. placing them on your mailing list), which they request in their letter. By definition, this is a service a consumer desires something (being put on your mailing list) and is willing to pay for it, and you fulfill their desire by performing the service of putting their name on your mailing list for a set fee. By sending money to others and writing \"please place me on your mailing list\", you do not ask to be entered into a lottery or win a prize based on chance, you are asking for a service. Therefore, this system is perfectly legal. Do not let apprehension and doubts stop you from trying this outstanding breakthrough in wealth-building. Remember------ you have NOTHING at all to lose!

A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make hundreds of thousands of dollars within weeks (which would soon turn into millions) with only an initial investment of $25.00! So I thought, \"Yeah right, this must be a scam\", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $5.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 250 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured \"What have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $25.00, right?\" Then I invested the measly $25.00 (I use the word \"measly\" because $25 really is measly compared to the money I have made through the initial investment)! Well GUESS WHAT!? within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000! In the third week I had over $10,000 and it\'s still growing. This is actually my fourth week now- and I have made a total of just over $42,000 and it\'s still coming in rapidly. It\'s certainly worth $25.00, and 5 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it works Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! Suggestion, Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It\'s easy. It\'s legal. And, your investment is only $25.00 (Plus postage) IMPORTANT This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends. NOTE Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the HONESTY and INTEGRITY of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it\'s a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 5 easy steps to success (STEP 1) Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper \"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST\", along with your name and address.  Now get 5 US $5.00 bills (or a combination of bills totaling $5) and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper (yellow is best) so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address (for legal purposes), and a $5.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal.  (STEP 2) Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses 1.Stefan Veliceasa Malini 120,Jud Suceava,cod 727350,Romania  2.Judith Sims 1700 S.Main St #155 Las Vegas,NV 89104  3.Vitalii Dubinka 123 S.E.3rd Avenue,#536 Miami,Florida 33131 4.Richard Schenk, 135 Fairview Avenue, Great Neck, New York  5. rob comunale 12480 larimer ave north huntingdon,pa 15642 (STEP 3) Now (CAREFULLY) take the #1 name OFF the list that you see above, move the other names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc ) and add \"YOUR\" name and address information,that will make you receive money(it is for real) as number 5. on the list. (STEP 4) Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.  (STEP 5) Now, post your amended article to at least 250 newsgroups on your web browser. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 250, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! You won\'t get very much unless you post like crazy. )This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &  1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the HONESTY and INTEGRITY of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of INTEGRITY, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way. NOTE You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy.  This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the cash in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, five  members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with five dollars each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $25.00 ($5.00 for each of the first five people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you\'re in business!  \"IMPORTANT\" Be sure to give  \"FIVE\" dollars per participant. Failure to do so will prevent the progress of this business, (PLEASE BE HONEST). DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1 You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting,  Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your  cursor to the bottom of this document (so that the document is \"highlighted\"), and select \'copy\' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer\'s memory. Step 2 Open a blank \'notepad\' file (such as in Microsoft Word) and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the \'edit\' menu select \'paste\'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step 3 Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different settings, you\'ll always have this file to go back to. Step 4 Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Step 5 Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit  menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You\'re done with your first one! Congratulations THAT\'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it should take only about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 250**  That\'s it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive! If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** Now the WHY part Out of 250 postings, say I receive only 5 replies ?(which would be a VERY LOW example!). So then I made $25.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $5.00 make the MINIMUM 250 postings, each with my name at #4 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $125.00 for me, now those 25 each make 250 MINIMUM posts with my name at #3 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $625! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 250 with my name at #2 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $3125! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 250 letters with my name at #1 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $15,625!!! With an original  investment of only $25.00!!!! UN-BELIEVABLE! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $25.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is do you realize that thousands upon thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $25.00 and see if it really works?? I think so People have said, \"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates ?are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. NOTE This program can and will work for you as long as you post the message in at least 250 newsgroups (e.g. message boards). This might take a long time, probably several hours. But remember, as far fetched and ridiculous as it seems, if you follow all the instructions of this system, you will become rich within an extremely short period of time. Believe me,  IT\'S WORTH IT!!! I just urge you to be fair and honest. As long as each person (including you!) sends $5 to everyone on the list, everybody (including you!) will become extremely wealthy within just a couple of months, and will start receiving money within the first week or two! Legal Note. This system is perfectly legal. It is not a lottery or a scheme intending to defraud, it is rather a business. It is part of the mail order business. By receiving money from others, you do not offer them a lottery or any prize based on chance; you simply offer them a service (i.e. placing them on your mailing list), which they request in their letter. By definition, this is a service a consumer desires something (being put on your mailing list) and is willing to pay for it, and you fulfill their desire by performing the service of putting their name on your mailing list for a set fee. By sending money to others and writing \"please place me on your mailing list\", you do not ask to be entered into a lottery or win a prize based on chance, you are asking for a service. Therefore, this system is perfectly legal. Do not let apprehension and doubts stop you from trying this outstanding breakthrough in wealth-building. Remember------ you have NOTHING at all to lose!

(1136,'Reducing Cost Without','Today?s times have become a stressful strain on single and working families today. Yet the childcare industry is still highly needed in order to continue working to provide and maintain your life. In the past looking over the smallest thing to save money wasn\'t as important as now-a-days. With everything such as groceries, gas and basic necessities prices climbing, it has become harder as time past just to get by. I can\'t help to realize how childcare facilities haven?t tried to adjust their prices to accommodate working families during these hard times and let?s face it without you they will not be operating! Why not find somewhere that really fits within your budget and at least save something!!!!(Every little helps). \n\nParents choose childcare based on: Price, Quality, Stability, , Company Reputation, Location, Appearance, Image, Payment Policies, Expertise, Curriculum, and Services...\n\nAs a former Pre-K teacher that has reached every goal I set out to accomplish with my previous students which in result allowed me to make a lot of friends and set a positive reputation for making learning interesting and fun. With all types of learning environments for the kids, this will allow them to receive a more hands on learning experience. From making a \"Kroger Shopping Center\" to making a bear cave that taught them how bears hibernate in the winter time, I HAVE DONE IT ALL!! As a new home daycare owner with a list of references I am offering the same services but saving families hundreds of dollars. If parents choose daycare based on what?s listed above, I have every field covered plus the environment that will reflect on the curriculum to keep children interested in learning.\n\nReducing costs without affecting quality is the main focus @ Each One Teach One Learning Center. The services that are being offered is more than what you paying for. Food provided(breakfast, lunch, and snack)outdoor/indoor play, nap time, daily schedule and activities, curriculum, summer camp program, weekly themes(child will participate in development appropriate activities throughout the day), centers, nursery, story time, puzzle games, arts & crafts, manipulatives and much more...Using my art skills to help implement my vision.\n \nIf your are interested or would like more info please call Lisa at 404-396-6088\n \nwww.eachoneteachonelearningcenter.vpweb.com',16,'',120,'20090219','9:06:33 MST',118,'','','','','','','',0,0,'eachoneteachonelc@yahoo.com',1,1,'East Cobb 30068 and surrounding areas',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1341559682','3dbbd',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),

This integrated phone, email client (with support for corporate email servers), organizer and web browser is the ultimate weapon for mobile professionals.\n\nThe 7290 follows the standard BlackBerry form factor-- a large 240 x 160 color screen placed above a QWERTY thumbpad. The screen offers plenty of real estate to view your emails, web browser content, messaging sessions and attachments. The popular BlackBerry user interface is here, too, which makes it easy to navigate the phone\'s functions. A jog dial is located on the right side of the unit for quick scrolling through menus and emails. There\'s also a standard 2.5mm headset jack that can be used with the included headset. A removable lithium-ion battery is housed in the rear of the unit.\n\nMany of the calling capabilities folks have come to expect in a wireless phone are present in the 7290. The unit\'s Bluetooth capability means you can use a wireless headset with the phone for handsfree calling. A vibrating alert, speed dial, and a contacts list/address book that is limited only by the unit\'s 32 MB of internal memory, are also included. \n\nLegendary BlackBerry Email Experience.\nYou can receive emails instantaneously from up to 10 email accounts (personal and enterprise). With BlackBerry push technology, you don\'t need to retrieve your email. BlackBerry devices are designed to remain on and continuously connected to the wireless network, allowing you to be discreetly notified as new email arrives. Support is also built-in for viewing email attachments (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, WordPerfect, and PDF formats). \n\nIf your company has BlackBerry Enterprise Server installed, you can take advantage of the power of wireless calendar synchronization. Your calendar events are exchanged wirelessly and automatically so that your desktop calendar and BlackBerry device calendar are synchronized. All your Outlook meeting requests, changes, and updates are instantaneously synchronized instantaneously with your desktop. Make meeting requests, invite new attendees and more, all on your 7290. Users without Enterprise Server support can manually sync with their desktop calendars and contacts via Bluetooth or USB using the included BlackBerry Desktop software.\n\nUse the 7290\'s Web browser to access the Internet from the palm of your hand. Browse Web sites, get up-to-date stock quotes, read the latest news, check weather reports and more. Wireless text messaging is also supported by the 7290.\n\nThe 7290 ships with a number of tools, including a calculator with a unit converter and a to-do list. The unit\'s software is based on the Java platform, meaning Java-compatible games and applications can be added to the device.\n\nThe RIM BlackBerry 7290 weighs 4.9 ounces and measures 4.5 x 2.9 x 0.9 inches. Its lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 4 hours of digital talk time, and up to 9 days of digital standby time.

(1189,'NEWREHAIR MIRACLE HAIR PRODUCTS WHOLESALE','Newrehair is natural nourishment for the skin and the hair. It is made of herbs and vitamins that keep the hair healthy.\nIt?s a natural product; it can be used at any age, for any gender, for any race. It nourishes and regenerates the hair as long as the follicles of the hair are not dead yet. So, if you see that you are loosing hair, do not wait until it is too late to start using Newrehair. For example, if the scalp of a bold man is smooth and shinny, it is most likely that the hair follicles are dead.\nHowever, patience is the key. Hair grows a quarter of an inch a month. So give some times to Newrehair to work to see major changes. Most people see major changes in 3 to 4 months.\nHow to use Newrehair?\nIt is good to massage the scalp with it and comb the hair after. As it is nourishment for the hair, it would be good to use it at least 3 times a week. However as we eat every day, using it every day would be the best. We forget that the same way we need nourishment every day for our body, our skin and hair need also nourishment every day. If we eat only once a week, we can not expect to take weight. The same way, if we nourish our hair every week, we can not expect it to be healthy and not fall.\n\nHow to order it?

(1247,'$60 Opportunity! Univ TX Women\'s Health Research','$60 Opportunity - Help us gather data on Women and their Physical Activity! \n\nHello,\n\nI am Cindy, a proud student of the University of Texas at Austin, and a research assistant for the University\'s Nursing School. Our research team is conducting an Internet survey study on the physical activity attitudes among diverse ethnic groups of American middle-aged women (40-60 Y/O).\n\nWe invite you to help us to increase awareness of the importance of women?s opinions and experiences by participating in our study and announcing it to your organization, family, and friends. Please visit our website at (http://mapa.nur.utexas.edu ) We know that all women will benefit from participation in our study. With more participation, the more complete our data will be.\n\nThe survey will begin by asking you a series of eligibility questions. If the study has filled our sampling quota for an individual with your characteristics you will receive a kind message that states so. Upon completion of the survey, you will be invited to join the optional online forum discussion. Sorry, but we are unable to translate the survey into any other language except English, hopefully this does not discourage anyone.\n\nPlus! Each participant will be rewarded a $10 gift card for the Internet survey and a $50 gift card for the online forum discussion (6 months).\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions about our study. Thank you so much for considering this study. Sorry for any duplicate emails.\nHave a great day!\n\nCindy \ncindyt86@gmail.com\n\n',19,'',121,'20090302','11:04:33 MST',161,'','','','','','','',0,0,'cindyt86@gmail.com',1,0,'Austin TX',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','1168358263','c2483',1,'0000-00-00','0000-00-00'),
